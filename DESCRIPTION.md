# Sano Pyramidi

## General
The game is about categorizing words that belong together. The user is faced with 15 words categorized in 4 different groups: 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 words.
The words are randomized in a pyramid structure with 1 word at the top and 5 in the bottom, ie 5 stories. Every word sits in a square.


## Gameplay
The user is suppose to select the words that belong together and clicks a "Check" button. If the user has selected the correct words the words get highlighted and moved into it's "right" place in the pyramid changing place with other words that might be on that level.
If the user hasn't selected all words in a category he "looses a point". You have in total 4 points.


## Design
When you have selected a correct category the whole level should turn into another color, preferably with an animation.
When you have made a mistake it would be nice with a little "shake" animation of the boxes.
The design in general should be clean and pretty minimalistic.


## Admin
There should be an admin mode where you can write categories and put in words per category. When "saving" the config should be encoded into the url and a shareable link to the actual game should be created.
